# Final_Project

Fork this repository for your final project. For week 3, you will be adding your project proposal to this README. The proposal just needs to be a description of what your project will be. The following elements are required in your project:

1. An Express server running on Node.
2. At least one module you have written `require`'d in and used on this server. This one may not be an Express router module.
3. At least one Express router module (this is in addition to the module required in #2.
4. A single page Backbone application to run in the browser. This application must include the following (4 modules total as a minimum):
   1. At least one Backbone model or collection module. If you're using a collection, define a separate model module for that collection.
   2. At least least 3 total Backbone view modules.
   3. At least one Backbone router module that supports at least 2 separate routes.
5. A **package.json** file that includes all your project dependencies and dev dependencies (basically everything necessary for me to npm install and run your application.)
6. An **.eslintrc** linting file. All of your code must be completely linted.

**I strongly recommend you keep your project simple**. There is a lot to do here, and any complexity will blow up the amount of time and effort required to complete it. Remember to build the simplest thing possible to achieve the task your application is meant to accomplish and avoid feature creep. You can always iterate on what you've built *after* you've completed the minimum viable product.

*include your proposal in this README after this line:*
I would like to propose a record collection cataloger for my final project. In the main interface, the user will be presented with a list of their records. They will be able to add, remove and edit their entries here. When the user chooses to add to their list, an add new item interface will appear. They will be able to add new records to the list and will have various options for cataloging their entries, such as:
Artist Name
Title
Label
Year
Genre
For Sale
Sold
Import
Format
Image
The user will be able to sort their list according to these options.
