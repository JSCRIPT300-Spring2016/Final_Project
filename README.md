# Final_Project

Fork this repository for your final project. For week 3, you will be adding your project proposal to this README. The proposal just needs to be a description of what your project will be. The following elements are required in your project:

1. An Express server running on Node.
2. At least one module you have written `require`'d in and used on this server. This one may not be an Express router module.
3. At least one Express router module (this is in addition to the module required in #2.
4. A single page Backbone application to run in the browser. This application must include the following (4 modules total as a minimum):
   1. At least one Backbone model or collection module. If you're using a collection, define a separate model module for that collection.
   2. At least least 3 total Backbone view modules.
   3. At least one Backbone router module that supports at least 2 separate routes.
5. A **package.json** file that includes all your project dependencies and dev dependencies (basically everything necessary for me to npm install and run your application.)
6. An **.eslintrc** linting file. All of your code must be completely linted.

**I strongly recommend you keep your project simple**. There is a lot to do here, and any complexity will blow up the amount of time and effort required to complete it. Remember to build the simplest thing possible to achieve the task your application is meant to accomplish and avoid feature creep. You can always iterate on what you've built *after* you've completed the minimum viable product.

Welcome to the Search for Hotels Website with Backbone JS MVC
Mobile-First Web Development
By Emma Luk, Web Developer

Why?
Static VS Dynamic Website with Backbone JS MVC 
1.	HTML by itself is static: one page at a time, any small change on the page requires the WHOLE page to be reloaded.

2.	Ajax practice gets around this, but requires DOM manipulation using JavaScript with data passed back and forth using XML / JSON (works, but tends to mix code with presentation).

3.	The goal of Backbone JS MVC is to keep HTML "CLEAN" while still enabling dynamic behaviour

How?
This application called Search for Hotels:
1.	My application: Using Backbone JS MVC: Model (Data), View (Presentation) and Controllers (Business Logic).
2.	Data Binding to update views automatically
3.	Moving data to scope & business logic to controllers
4.	Organizing my code using Modules
5.	Create Single page application (SPA)


HTML by itself is static: one page at a time, 
any small change on the page requires the WHOLE page to be reloaded
