Nachos at Maplewood
- beef nachos, very good, not as good as Mount Si, probably not as good as Willows Run, compared to Druids Glen? don't know/remember
- definitely better than Eagles Pride which remains in second-to-last place (behind Washington National which were terrible)

Nachos at Eagles Pride
- messy
- not bad, better than Washington National
- also better than Maplewood but those may have been better if with beef instead of chicken (chunks of chicken, not ground)

Nachos at Druids Glen - jump into second place!  Behind only Mount Si and moving ahead of Willows Run (black beans in nachos - yum)

Keep track of Nacho Tour events
-	Nacho quality

Eventually turn into a web site


Mount Si – best nachos so far, maragarita’s not bad
Willows Run – close second, best margarita
Bellevue GC – no nachos, cheese quesadilla and chips and salsa weren’t terrible
Washington National – nachos left much to be desired
The Home Course – no restaurant, “totchos” at McNamara’s Pub in Du Pont were OK
Lake Spanaway – nachos pretty good but still behind Mount Si and Willows Run, margaritas OK
